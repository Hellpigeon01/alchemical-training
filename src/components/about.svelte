				<h2>Abigail Crowe</h2>
				<p>
					I have dedicated thousands of hours to training clients, and countless more preparing
					personalized sessions. Every moment spent acquiring certifications, graduating college,
					studying, lifting, and personal training has been driven by a pursuit of excellence and a
					desire to serve others. My purpose in life is centered around my clients, not myself. I
					love my job because I see people transform, becoming autonomous, more confident,
					pain-free, and stronger both physically and mentally.
				</p>
				<p>
					I witness an alchemical process unfold, despite the calculated and methodical efforts put
					in by both my clients and me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Strength training is a significant commitment and can often seem overwhelming or even
					dangerous. However, strength comes in many forms. My goal is to help clients achieve their
					objectives through any necessary modalityâ€”whether it's strength, stability, power,
					endurance, or more. A healthy, prepared human is a confident human, and a confident human
					is ready to conquer the world. I hope to be a part of your journey to success.
