				"At age 40, I gathered the courage to try the gym for the first time! I had always been a
				runner and found my health benefits on the trails. I knew that weightlifting was important
				and would help me stay strong and mobile as I entered my middle years.
				<br /><br />
				After a quick training assessment interview at Momentum, I was paired with Abigail. She took
				me under her wing and without hesitation began guiding me along my fitness journey.
				<br /><br />
				In May, we will celebrate our 4 year anniversary! Abigail is one of the most intuitive, intelligent,
				driven and supportive trainers! As my goals have shifted over the years, she has supported and
				shifted with me. She always offers me advice and encouragement, changes the direction of my workouts
				to suit my goals and keeps me challenged appropriately! She truly understands muscle mechanics!
				<br /><br />
				As a biology major myself, it is truly incredible to hear her analysis and rational for specific
				movements! Beyond training, Abigail has become a wonderful friend. She has the ability to know
				where I am physically and mentally each and every time I walk into the gym! She keeps me accountable
				and is always the brightest part of my week. Abigail days are the best days!"

						have dealt with injuries on and off that had prevented me from competing at times. I
						started working with Abigail a year ago and the transformation I've gone through has
						been even better than I ever imagined. Staying injury-free and racing better than I have
						in the last 7+ years is all from working with Abigail. I know that I wouldn't be able to
						do what I love without her help and am so grateful to her. Abigail will forever be my
						trainer!"

					"I can't say enough good things about Abigail. From the minute we signed Hunter up until
					now she has always focused on making him a better athlete focusing on both his strengths
					and weaknesses.
					<br /><br />
					Not only does he have fun with her, but she challenges him to get better, stronger, and has
					encouraged and guided him with improving his nutrition. Hunter always looks forward to sessions
					with Abigail and always asks to add more. She is very relatable to the boys and is also their
					biggest cheerleader. She has come to games and taken notes on what they need to improve on
					in the gym to improve in their sport.
					<br /><br />
					Hunter has gained great strength and mobility that has improved his hitting, throwing, and
					leg strength as a catcher. He has improved on his “pop” and throw down times as a catcher working
					with Abigail. Hunter struggled with speed when he first went to Abigail. He has gotten faster
					on the bases and continues to improve each season.
					<br /><br />
					The group of boys love Abigail and she really connects with them and is flexible with their
					almost impossible schedules. Hunter really respects her and always looks forward to their sessions.
					As a young teen it can be hard to motivate kids to want to work out. No motivation needed to
					go to Abigail! She makes it fun but they work hard and come out sore! 10 stars!!!!”

				"Abigail is an amazing trainer and she works us hard but it pays off. I have gotten A LOT
				stronger training with Abigail. She’s a great person. She knows what she is doing. We have a
				lot of fun. The trainings are hard but fun! I have gotten faster for sure I used to be
				REALLY slow but I am not anymore. I recommend Abigail 100%. Even in a group setting she
				focuses on what I need to do individually as well. She is also super cool!"

				"After nearly 40 years of “working out” on my own, from football weight room training in
				high school and college to running marathons and over 100 road races in my 30s-40s, Abigail
				is the first personal trainer I ever worked with.
				<br /><br />
				On day one, I carried around more body fat than I had at any point. I had knee, shoulder and
				elbow pain and loss of function that seemed to require surgery. Abigail sat me down and we assessed
				where I was and what my goals were.
				<br /><br />
				She tailored an overall plan to reach those goals and modified each work out based on where I
				actually was AND how I felt going into that day. Along the way, Abigail kept me honest and accountable
				with focus on building strength, endurance and flexibility through proper form and technique.
				And, she reminded me (with some success) on diet and lifestyle choices that matter as much or
				more than what I did in the gym.
				<br /><br />
				Abigail consistently challenged my old notions of what “working out” meant. She got me out of
				my comfort zone trying new exercises and techniques, many I never heard of and, at times, a few
				I thought she was just making up (she wasn't).
				<br /><br />
				She's listens to her clients and is an excellent communicator who pays close attention to every
				detail. If we aren't doing it correctly, we aren't going to do it. Just because I want to add
				weight to an exercise doesn't make it a good idea - She has saved me more times than I can count
				from doing something foolish simply because I thought I was 25 years old again. After the first
				3-4 months, that chronic pain in in all three areas (knee, shoulders and elbows) is virtually
				gone.
				<br /><br />
				Today, my overall strength, flexibility, endurance and BMI are the best they've been in nearly
				20 years. I feel better and sleep better than I have in years. I'm doing things physically I
				wasn't able to do 10 years ago. Bottom line — Abigail is the best and I wouldn't be where I am
				today without her expertise and guidance."

						"When I was 17 years old I had the privilege to start training with Abigail. At this
						time, I was trying to be recruited after recovering from a foot surgery that took me
						months to fully recover. In this time I lost a lot of muscle and was not confident in
						myself to be recruited at a top-level school.
						<br /><br />
						Abigail stepped up alongside Drew Whitehead and made a plan of action for me to not only
						accomplish my goal but to [exceed] them. Throughout this journey, Abigail was not only just
						my trainer but also a mentor and a friend. She made sacrifices and studied the game of softball
						to make me a stronger and better competitor both mentally and physically. I could not have
						asked for a better trainer, and I will forever be grateful for her.
						<br /><br />
						I am now 20 years old and play at the University of West Florida. I led my team in home runs
						last year as a freshman and I am starting my sophomore year at second base. I still look
						forward to coming back and training with her because she still challenges me and pushes me
						to be better every day. She is the total package. A mentor, a friend, and a hell of a strength
						coach.”

					"It's a rare and beautiful thing when people find their calling in life and then get to do
					that for a living. When you meet Abigail Crowe, it's instantly clear she's living her
					calling.
					<br /><br />
					She has a palpable passion not just for fitness, but also seeing her clients thrive. For years,
					the gym was my stress reliever. However, last year life threw me some serious health challenges.
					All the strength and cardio gains I'd been building over the years came to a halt.
					<br /><br />
					I'd been training with Abigail for a few months and one day, I was really struggling physically
					and mentally during our session. She looked at me and said, "Just show up and move. That's
					all I need you to do." She met me where I was at and it was such a game changer for me.
					<br /><br />
					I'm still not to where I was, but I'm on my way back using movement as medicine.
					<br /><br />
					There are a lot of knowledgeable trainers out there, but what sets Abigail a part is her emotional
					intelligence. She truly invests in her clients, creating a program that not only takes their
					fitness goals into account, but also what's going on in their lives. Whether you're just starting
					out, need a push or are a star athlete, she will absolutely help you meet your goals!"
