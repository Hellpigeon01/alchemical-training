Our beta testers have spoken, and we listened closely. Many of you shared with us that the tables were a bit tricky to use and entering data felt cumbersome. We took these comments to heart. It became clear that SceneGrinders table functionality needed a serious makeover, so that's exactly what we did. We've reimagined and rebuilt the table system from scratch, aiming to make them more intuitive and user-friendly for you.

If you've been working with us for a while and have projects already underway, you'll need to take a moment to update your tables. Just head over to the table section in your world, and you'll find an 'Upgrade' button at the top of the screen waiting for you.

And because we're excited for you to see the changes, we've put together a short video highlighting the new features and the smoother interactivity of the tables in SceneGrinder. We hope you'll love the improvements as much as we do!
