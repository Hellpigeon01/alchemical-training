## Introduction
The process of going from being generally fit to shredded can be daunting, miserable, and dreadful, especially if done wrong.  Most people assume they need to hang the hat on having any semblance of fun or actually enjoying food, and so they never even try.

What if I told you that you could have fun, eat good food, and achieve the body you want? You down? Cool. Listen up then! 


## Energy Expenditure
In order to lose weight, humans must consume less energy than they expend. This essentially just means you need to eat less than you burn in a day. Now, the body is complex and thus environmental and hormonal factors can interfere with this basic metabolic principle, but this is the general principle that the body operates off of. 

<h3 style="color: goldenrod;">Energy In</h3>
The food we eat. Protein, carbohydrates, fats, fiber, and alcohol are all foods/drinks consumed that make up our total energetic consumption. 

The quick breakdown for getting lean? Increase protein, keep carbohydrates and fats at lower but reasonable ranges, keep fiber intake high and alcohol consumption minimal.

<div style="text-align: center;"><i>“Abigail, what the hell is a reasonable range?”</i></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><strong>Good question.</strong></i></p>

While everyone is going to have different preferences and potentially different requirements based on doctor/nutritionist recommendations, these are solid ranges to start with. 

- **Keep protein intake at 25-30% of daily intake.** 

- **Keep fats at 25-30% of daily intake.**

- **Keep carbohydrates at 40-45% of daily intake.**

<h3 style="color: goldenrod;">Energy Out</h3>
This section is for my foodies. When calories start becoming fairly restricted and hunger levels go up, we can also manipulate energy output! The last thing I want to do when I’m trying to get lean is cut calories, so usually I begin with a very small calorie deficit and an increase in activity- low intensity steady state cardio, high intensity interval training, a hot yoga class, a few games of pickleball, etc. Adding more movement into the day allows for an increase in energy expenditure, and thus less calories having to be pulled. YAY!

## The Guide
The part that everyone will skip to. Why you people are really here. The steps! The simple guide for getting lean and staying lean.

1. Eat 1g protein/lb body weight. EVERY DAY.

2. Make your meals nutrient dense with a lot of fruits and vegetables.

3. Avoid snacking. Snacking is a wonderful way to accidentally eat your way into a caloric surplus without even realizing it.

4. Processed foods and sugars not only make you feel like crap, but they also are highly addictive and not satiating at all. Enjoy life, plan for 1-2 treats during the week, and then go back to eating healthy.

5. Alcohol is not your friend. If you do want to enjoy a cocktail on occasion, stick to liquor…and no…not a super sugary mixed drink.

6. Night time is often snack time; plan to have a healthy snack if you choose to do so and then drink a glass of water, brush your teeth, and be done.

7. On the water note, DRINK WATER. Dehydration is a fast track to feeling horrible and also being hungry all the time.

8. Caffeine is a stimulant and appetite suppressant. Don’t go slamming 100s of milligrams every day, but adding in a little extra caffeine may help.

9. Get proper sleep. This will allow for your hunger hormones and cortisol to remain regulated, and will make the dieting process so much easier.

10. Move more. Find ways to add movement into your day. (yes, cardio is a thing. Sorry people.)

**And that is pretty much it!**
Follow these tips for a while and watch your body completely transform. Catch ya on the flip.
